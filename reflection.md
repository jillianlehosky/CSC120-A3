Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which classmates did you consult with while working on this assignment?
I worked with Dani Forte and talked to someone in class who'd name I totally forget and am very embarassed by that fact.
- Which session(s) of TA / office hours did you attend?
I was unable to attend any tutor or TA hours.
- What are your initial impressions of Java? 
I am starting to like it and understand it more after doing this assignment. Switching to object oriented is definitely very hard and I think my brain is still trying to do make that thinking switch. I'm still definitely stuggling with assigning variable types, and how calling a method affects the object it is being called on. 
- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages? 
With nerly anything I wanted to do, there was already a built-in method or an "easy" way to accomplish a task. I tend to overcomplicate things when planning out a program and need to remind myself to take a step back and really look at all of the tools that the whatever language has accessible already. 
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
I think having a really detailed psuedocode plan for this assignment was super useful. I didn't really reference it once I started programming, but it helped me to realize everything I had to do. I also tried to get a minimally working program and added the more complicated elements in one at a time which made me feel secure in whatever I had done already.
